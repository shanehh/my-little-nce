# He often does this

What had happened to the writers bag?

After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasnt there! As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.

Did you have a good meal?" he asked.

Yes, thank you, I answered, but I cant pay the bill. I havent got my bag.

The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

Im very sorry, he said. My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!
