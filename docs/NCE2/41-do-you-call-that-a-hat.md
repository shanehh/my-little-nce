# Do you call that a hat?

Do you call that a hat? I said to my wife.

You neednt be so rude about it, my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.
I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.
We mustnt buy things we dont need, I remarked suddenly. I regretted saying it almost at once.

You neednt have said that, my wife answered. I neednt remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.

I find it beautiful, I said. A man can never have too many ties.

And a woman cant have too many hats, she answered.

Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!
