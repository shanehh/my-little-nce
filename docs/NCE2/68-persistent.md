Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist?

I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you. I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.

Hello, Nigel, I said. Fancy meeting you here!

Hi, Elizabeth, Nigel answered. I was just wondering how to spend the morning -- until I saw you. Youre not busy doing anything, are you?

No, not at all, I answered. Im going to...

Would you mind my coming with you? he asked, before I had finished speaking.

Not at all, I lied, but Im going to the dentist.

Then Ill come with you, he answered. Theres always plenty to read in the waiting room!
