# Taken for a ride

Why did the writer not get off the bus at Woodford Green?

I love travelling in the country, but I dont like losing my way.

I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.

Im going to Woodford Green, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I dont know where it is.

Ill tell you where to get off. answered the conductor.

I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside. After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.

Youll have to get off here, the conductor said. This is as far as we go.

Is this Woodford Green? I asked.

Oh dear, said the conductor suddenly. I forgot to put you off.

It doesnt matter, I said. Ill get off here.

Were going back now, said the conductor.

Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus, I answered.
