# It could be worse

Had the writers money been stolen?

I entered the hotel managers office and sat down. I had just lost $50 and I felt very upset. I left the money in my room, I said, and its not there now. The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing. Everyones losing money these days, he said. He started to complain about this wicked world but was interrupted by a knock at the door. A girl came in and put an envelope on his desk. It contained $50. I found this outside this gentlemans room, she said. Well, I said to the manager, there is still some honesty in this world!
